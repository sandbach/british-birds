"Curlew","Numenius arquata","The Curlew is the largest European wading bird, found on estuaries in winter and moors in summer. Look for its down-curved bill, brown upperparts, long legs and listen for its evocative, bubbling, call.

In the winter, you’ll see Curlews feeding in groups on tidal mudflats, saltmarshes and nearby farmland. While some of our birds spend the winter in Ireland and France, we get an influx of Scandinavian-breeding Curlews here, who make the most of our relatively mild winters. In the spring and summer, Curlews migrate to their breeding grounds in upland areas of rough pasture, heather moorland and wetland.

Curlews breed on a range of habitats, but like rough grasslands, moorlands and bogs best of all. Intensive farming practices, including drainage and reseeding, are likely to have contributed to declines in breeding populations, as has the turning of areas of moorlands into forest. Together, these activities are having a huge impact on Curlew populations.

Curlew numbers are also impacted by nest predators, mainly foxes, who take eggs, chicks and adult birds. Like many wading birds, Curlews lay their eggs in a nest on the ground known as a ‘scrape’. The parents incubate the eggs for about four weeks, before the young leave the nest and roam around with their parents for a further four weeks until fledging.

The UK breeding population of Curlews is of international importance, with around 30% of the west European population spending winter in the UK. Despite this, there have been worrying declines in the breeding population in much of the UK. In 2015, Curlews were added to the Red List on the UK Conservation Status Report. Red is the highest conservation priority, with species on this list needing urgent action. Curlews are struggling, with big declines in breeding populations and ranges.

"Cuckoo","Cuculus canorus","The Cuckoo is a dove-sized bird with a blue-grey back, head and chest, and stripey black and white belly. Its sleek body, long tail and pointed wings gives it an appearance not unlike Kestrels or Sparrowhawks.

Cuckoos are summer visitors and known for being brood parasites. This means that, instead of building their own nest, the females lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, especially Meadow Pipits, Dunnocks and Reed Warblers. When a female Cuckoo finds a suitable nest, and the hosts aren’t looking, she removes one of their eggs and lays her own egg in its place. Cuckoo young hatch after just 12 days, and push the hosts’ eggs or babies out of the nest, allowing it to eat all food brought by the host bird. By the time the Cuckoo leaves the nest, it is far bigger than the host bird, but the adoptive parent continues to feed the young Cuckoo for a further two weeks.

With their young being raised by another bird, adult Cuckoos are free to leave the UK much earlier. Most leave during June for Africa, where they spend winter. The young Cuckoos leave later on, once they’re fully fledged.
 
Their recent population decline makes this a Red List species in the 2021 UK Conservation Status Report. Red is the highest conservation priority, with species on this list needing urgent action. Species on this list, such as Cuckoos, are globally threatened, with big declines in breeding populations and ranges.","The {{c1:Cuckoo}} is a dove-sized bird with a blue-grey back, head and chest, and stripey black and white belly.

"Turtle Dove","Streptopelia turtur","The Turtle Dove is a dainty dove, much smaller and darker than the Collared Dove - slightly larger than a Blackbird. Its upperparts are distinctively mottled with chestnut and black, and its black tail has a white edge.

Turtle doves are migratory, heading off to Africa in the winter. When they arrive in the UK in spring, they build nests in hedgerows and scrub. They prefer thorny species, such as hawthorn, and will often build nests among climbers, including honeysuckle.

They eat seeds, and feed on the ground in weedy areas or in the short stubble after a harvest. Seeds such as chickweed and oilseed rape, as well as cereal grains, are important food sources for Turtle Doves.

The Turtle Dove’s gentle purr is an evocative sound of summer, but has become increasingly rare following rapid and sustained population declines. One cause of the decline is thought to be lack of seed and grain during the breeding season, resulting in a much shorter breeder season with fewer nesting attempts.

The Turtle Dove has been on the Red List in the UK since 1996, and it remains there today. Red is the highest conservation priority, with species on this list needing urgent action. There have been huge efforts across the UK to save Turtle Doves, including Operation Turtle Dove, an RSPB-led project to work with farmers, landowners and communities to create nesting and feeding habitats for Turtle Doves across Southern and Eastern England.

In 2021, the Turtle Dove was RSPB England’s Bird of the Year, in honour of the fantastic work being done to help this vulnerable species.
